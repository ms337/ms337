# Hi, I'm Madhav.

I am final year CS undergraduate in Canada. My technical skills are in backend, data and ML engineering, developed through projects and 12 months of internship experiences.

I am graduating in April 2022 and thus I am currently looking for summer internships and new grad roles in software engineering and related technical areas. 


## Currently

- Going back to school in September to finish up my last year of university.
- Working full-time on a potential startup project in generative deep learning that generates new photos of people.


## In the last 6 months

- Contributed to https://covid.army/ and joined the team to lead the backend contributors. Transitioned out when things stabilized to work on my own project. 
- Spent time learning vector analyis and explored computational biology.  
- Interned on the data science team at a PE firm doing everything from data engineering, full stack development, some NLP work and traditional data science work.
